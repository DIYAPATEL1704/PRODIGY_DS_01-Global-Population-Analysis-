# 📊 Global Population Analysis – Data Science Task 1

## 🚀 Internship Project – Prodigy InfoTech

As part of my Data Science internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, I completed an exciting task focused on global population trends using World Bank data. This project involved data analysis and visualization to extract meaningful insights from population statistics.

## 🔍 Task Overview

**Objective:**  
Create visualizations using population data to highlight key insights related to total, male, and female populations over different years.

---

## 📈 Project Highlights

- 🔹 **Top 10 Populated Countries in 2022**
- 🔹 **Least 10 Populated Countries in 2022**
- 🔹 **Top 10 Male Populated Countries in 2020**
- 🔹 **Least 10 Female Populated Countries in 2018**
- 🔹 **Stacked Bar Plot of Top 10 Populated Countries in 2016 (Male & Female)**

All visualizations were created using clean bar charts and stacked bars for better clarity and comparison.
